http://vinceg.net/GuitarProject/AppendixD.htm -- he seems to take way too long on some parts. but this is his "one guitar build".  I'd need to cut the time down to about 1/4.
but looking at his schedule, he spent 2x the finishing time, and 50 hours on jigs and drawings, something I'd not include in my production time estimates.
And then electronics. I spent about 2 hours on electronics, completely, and that was redoing it 2-3x...  I think I could get it down to 1 hour instead of his 5+.
So - I guess, just another data point.
