Necks are built with hickory wood fretboards (dyed dark brown/black).
Maple / cherry / beech / etc laminated necks (whatever is local).
That's the ticket! LOCAL!

You can do epoxy inlays (dots with epoxy inside)
side dots

Fretboard is cut with laser cutter

Laser cut the fretboard. Attach to neck blank (with small tack pins).  Route the neck blank based on the fingerboard.
